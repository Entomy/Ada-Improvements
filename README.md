# Ada-Improvements
Repository of Ada language improvement ideas.

## Goal
Ada won't change, and that's okay. But there are some in the community who'd like to see an Ada-inspired language, and we should collect those ideas in as open and transparent of a process as possible.

*This project is only about the language, not the standard library*.

*This project is a sister of [Ada-exploits](https://github.com/Entomy/Ada-exploits) and intends to address those problems as well.*

These ideas will not be implemented any time soon. I'd like to give it plenty of time for the community to discuss these matters.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute there are a few options

### New Proposals
Proposals are made by submitting an [Issue](https://github.com/Entomy/Ada-Improvements/issues/new/choose). Pick an appropriate template and fill it out.

### Discussion
Proposals often need some discussion, this can be potential pitfalls or tweaks to the proposal. These should be made as comments to the [Issues](https://github.com/Entomy/Ada-Improvements/issues).

### Voting
Votes on proposals are calculated as the ratio of üëç/üëé reactions on the proposal. No other reactions will be considered. Note that a high approval rating does not immediately qualify a proposal for implementation.
